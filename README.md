#tomoauto
## Version 0.2.15
### About
tomoauto is a wrapper-library written in Lua to automate the alignment,
correction and recontstruction of cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET)
tilt-series. Coupled with high-throughput collection, tomoauto drastically
speeds up data processing so that more time can be spent on data analysis.

tomoauto is simply a script that handles the use of several popular software
packages in the field and simplifies their use in collection by globalizing the
command line calls and configuration. It has been running in some form or
fashion in our lab for the last 3 years with good results.

Recent releases have expanded the original functionality to handle direct
detector cameras, dose-fractionation, and more complex operations on MRC files.

It is a very rough release and has many TODOs that have yet to be implemented.

### Change Log
#### 0.2.15
 * Wrote a new installation script and packaged with sources for lua and needed
   Lua libraries.
#### 0.2.10
 * Changed final files kept to save space and rely on options available in 3dmod
 * As of IMOD 4.7.9 autofidseed works better than RAPTOR to generate the
   fiducial seed model and is now default. RAPTOR can still be used by passing
   the appropriate option (see tomoauto --help).
#### 0.2.0
 * Added mode option to stop at alignment, ccderase, or to only perform
   reconstruction
 * Stopped using RAPTOR to generate the alignment, now it only produces the
   fiducial seed model and then IMOD performs the alignment.
 * No longer using a folder with the basename which helps keep things clean and
   organized when using the align and then the reconstruct mode.
 * Removed all batch commands, handle them yourself with the shell.
 * Added programs to create a newstack from drift-corrected images collected by
   dose-fractionation.
 * Added a pretty substantial lua module to handle MRC files.
 * Most of the IMOD commands handle multi-core automatically so removed -p
   option.
