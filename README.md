# README - tomoAuto 
tomoAuto is a Lua program to automate the alignment, correction and
contstruction of cryo electron tomography(Cryo-ET) data. Coupled with
high-throughput collection, tomoAuto drastically speeds up data processing so
that more time can be spent on data analysis.

tomoAuto is simply a script that handles the use of several popular software
packages in the field and simplifies their use in collection by globalizing the
command line calls and configurations.
